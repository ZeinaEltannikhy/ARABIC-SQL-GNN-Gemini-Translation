# Text-to-SQL using GNN and NLP

This repository hosts a project that explores the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to convert unstructured text queries into structured SQL statements.

## 📌 Project Components

### 1. `gnn-gemini.ipynb`
A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the use of Graph Neural Networks for entity understanding and relation mapping in query tasks.

### 2. `Text To SQL Task/`
A complete project folder for a text-to-SQL task, including data preprocessing, training scripts, and evaluation.

## 🚀 Objective

To develop a pipeline capable of interpreting natural language and generating SQL queries using advanced machine learning and deep learning models.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyTorch / TensorFlow (if applicable)
- Graph Neural Networks (e.g., PyTorch Geometric)
- NLP Libraries (e.g., spaCy, NLTK, Transformers)
